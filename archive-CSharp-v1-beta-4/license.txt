==============================================================================

The Cat C# source files are public domain.

You can get eliminate the MIT license on the executable by simply re-compiling
the source files yourself. If you compile the source files yourself you have
a new product which is no longer bound to the MIT license.

This protects me from liability, while still making everything free and without
restriction.
